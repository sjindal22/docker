## Hello World and Dockerfiles

### docker run hello-world

hello-world is the image name and docker first tries to find local instance of 
the image. Name after colon is called as tag. If you don't mention anything, 
docker will default to "latest tag. Because it couldn't find
"hello-world" latest tag locally, it is going to pull
from default registry of docker.

Docker registry/hub: Bunch of managed docker images.
They are managed by account called library and image name.

#### Commands and explanations

`docker ps`
Actively running Docker.

Shows all containers on the system.
`docker ps -a`

`docker rm <docker-id> or <docker-name>`

3. How would you build a container?

It requires a templated file. A docker file consists of
series of instructions/commands and arguments. You have a
base image, which is initial building block.

#https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/
c83a065a24e94e635ddd518c2a3cffc91accf30d/amd64/
hello-world/Dockerfile

"Scratch" is one of the multiple base images.
"hello" is a directory, where docker file is built.
copy hello directory into root directory of the container.
"/hello" is the command for running container instance.

4. Running customized docker file:

Whenever you want to run customized docker file, use
following command and give an image name:
#docker build . -t shivika-hello-world

The following command will run docker image. It basically
mean, we successfully built container image/hello-world
application.
#docker run shivika-hello-world

It is always recommended to remove any exited instance of
the container image.

SUMMARY:
You would create a docker file, include necessary base
image, have a command to run. Build the container, that
would create a container image and then using the image
name, you run an instance of it
